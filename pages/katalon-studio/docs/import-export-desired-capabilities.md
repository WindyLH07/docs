title: "Reusing Desired Capabilities across projects"

When desired capabilities need to use across projects, users have to manually re-define them again in a project in use, which is time-consuming and error-prone. 

Consequently, from version 8.0.0, Katalon Studio allows you to import and export desired capabilities in the Katalon Studio project(s). These functions support you to work with [Desired Capabilities](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/introduction-to-desired-capabilities.html) more efficiently and less error-prone.
