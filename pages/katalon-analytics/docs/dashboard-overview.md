The TestOps Dashboard module provides you an overview of recent test activities and upcoming releases. This module highlights your testing with real-time data assembled in three dashboards, which drive insights and assist you in the decision-making process.

The three dashboards are:

* Test Activities
* Release Readiness
* Local Test Environment

## Test Activities

This section allows you to monitor:

* The number of passed and failed test runs each week.

* How much time test execution takes each day.

* The number of test cases and their results.

* How the ratio of passed and failed test runs change, week by week.

## Release Readiness

This section allows you to:

* Assess the status of the two most recent releases.

* Oversee your release plan with reminders for the delivery date.

* Monitor productivity to see progress in development and testing.

* Highlight the total number of defects for each release.

## Local Test Environment

This section allows you to view:

* How many offline agents are setup for your local tests.
* The distribution of offline agents by operating system.
