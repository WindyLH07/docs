## Trial License

Valid email registration is eligible for a **30-day** trial of both **Katalon Studio Enterprise** and **Katalon Runtime Engine** floating licenses.

> The trial licenses are automatically generated and activated when you first log into the Katalon Studio application.

Each trial license can be activated on only one machine at a time.

You can start using KSE and KRE for 30 days. When your trial period expires, you need to purchase licenses to continue using KSE and KRE, or you can use the Katalon Studio free license with basic testing features.

> Notes:
>
> For **Offline license**, you cannot remove a machine ID registered for the trial licenses once it has been activated.

To purchase licenses, see [Purchase Katalon License](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-subscription.html).

To activate trial licenses, see [Activate Katalon License](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/activate-KSE.html).
## Free License

The free license granted for each Katalon account only includes the standard Katalon Studio with basic features. Currently, the free license for Katalon Runtime Engine is not available. If you wish to execute Katalon Studio in console mode, you need to subscribe to a Katalon Runtime Engine license. At any time, you can upgrade the free Katalon Studio to Katalon Studio Enterprise without re-download.
