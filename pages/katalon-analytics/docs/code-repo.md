TestOps no longer supports this feature.

You can no longer upload test scripts as a .zip file to a script repository in Katalon TestOps.

For existing users, you can continue using the current .zip script repositories for scheduling test runs. However, you cannot edit the script repositories nor upload a new .zip file.

The best practice is to upload test scripts from a Git repository. We encourage you to use the Git script repository for version control. See: [Upload Test Scripts from a Git Repository](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/git-test-project.html).
