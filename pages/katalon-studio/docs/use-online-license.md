## Grant an online license

> Notes:
> 
> An **online license** of Katalon Studio Enterprise (KSE) and Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE) is transferable among registered users of an organization as long as the number of active licenses does not exceed the license quota. See: [Transfer License](link).

> Requirements:
>
> You must add team members to your Organization. See: [TestOps User Management](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt_invite_user_org.html#invite-a-user-to-join-an-organization).
>
> The Owner or Admin of an Organization can grant licenses to any team member. The Owner or Admin can also revoke this action anytime.

Follow these steps to grant KSE licenses:

1. Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login), then go to **Settings** > **License Management**.

    The **Licenses** page appears as below.

2. Choose between KSE (Node-locked) and KSE (Floating).

3. Grant an online license to users by adding them in the **Licensed Users** section.

   Once the licensed users activate KSE, their machine IDs are added in the **Online Licenses** section.

   > Notes:
   >
   > The number of licensed users cannot exceed the license quota.

For KRE, all users of an Organization can use KRE online licenses by default once the KRE licenses are purchased.

To optimize license usage and avoid session termination, the Owner and Admin must remember the following rules:

* Each session accounts for one license.
* The number of parallel sessions cannot exceed the license quota.
* The number of registered machine IDs cannot exceed the license quota.
* Users need [API Keys](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/katalon-apikey-70.html) to activate a KRE online license.

## Grant an offline license

An **offline license** allows you to use KSE and KRE without internet. Once you activate an offline license, you cannot revoke or transfer it to a different machine. An offline license expires at the end of your subscription period. It can also be expired earlier than its actual date if you make changes in the offline license file.

When an offline license expires, you can generate a new offline license file to continue using KSE/KRE offline, or you can switch to an online license instead.

As a machine ID is required to create an offline license, Katalon generates a machine ID based on the hardware specifications and the user's account logging in to that machine at the generation time.

For example, if User A logs in to Machine A, Katalon generates a machine ID X. At the same time, if User B logs in to Machine A, Katalon generates a machine ID Y. This means that you need two licenses to use KSE/KRE in this case.

> Requirements:
>
> An **annual** node-locked license.

> Notes:
>
> A KSE/KRE license, once converted to an offline license, is bound to a machine until its expiry dateÂ (in **60 days**). You should generate an offline license with cautions as you cannot undo this action.

This tutorial is for:

* The Owner/Admins of an Organization that has purchased KSE/KRE licenses.
* Users who need offline licenses.

### Step 1: Users view and send a machine ID to the Owner/Admins

As a user, you need to copy the machine ID on which you use Katalon Studio, then send the machine ID to your Owner/Admins.

Follow these steps:

1. Download and open Katalon Studio.
2. In the **Katalon Studio Enterprise Activation** log, click **Offline Activation** to view and copy the machine ID.

3. Send the machine ID to the Owner/Admins.

### Step 2: Owner/Admins create offline licenses and send them to Users

As an Owner/Admin, you create an offline license by following these steps:

1. Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login).
2. Go to **Settings** > **License Management**.
3. Choose between KSE (Node-locked) and KRE (Node-locked).
4. Click on the **Create Offline License** button at the top right corner.

5. Enter the User's machine ID, then click **Create**.

    > Notes:
    >
    > You should check the machine ID and make sure you download and distribute offline licenses to the right users.

6. Confirm your action.

    For KSE, the newly-created offline license is named `KSE_<machineID>.lic` and added in the **Offline Licenses** section.

    For KRE, the newly-created offline license is named `KRE_<machineID>.lic` and added in the **Offline Licenses** section.

### Step 3: Users use offline licenses

#### For Katalon Studio Enterprise

As an user, you download the offline license and store it in your machine, then follow these steps:

1. In the **Katalon Studio Enterprise Activation** log, click **Offline Activation**.
2. Browse the license file with the corresponding machine ID.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/create-offline-kse-licenses/activate.png" width="498" height="" alt="kse activation log">

You now can use KSE in an offline environment.

#### For Katalon Runtime Engine

As an user, you can use the KRE offline license to execute KSE from the command-line interface and in the offline environment.

* For **Execute a single session**, put an offline license file (named `KRE_<machineID>.lic`) in the **license** folder.
* For **Execute multiple sessions in parallel**, put multiple offline license files in the **license** folder.

Depending on your operating system, you can find the **license** folder as follows:

* For Windows: **C:\Users\<user_name>\.katalon\license**.

  <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/activate-RE/license.png" width="" height="" alt="license folder location">

* For Linux: **/home/<user_name>/.katalon/license**

* For MacOS: **/Users/<user_name>/.katalon/license**

  > Notes:
  >
  > **.katalon** is a hidden folder.
