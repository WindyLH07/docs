Katalon Studio can natively integrate with both Jira Cloud and Jira Server. This integration helps you:

* Link a Katalon Studio project with a Jira project.
* Import Test Cases from Jira to Studio for creating test cases, and BDD tests.
* Automatically submit test results and their attachments to the linked Jira issue.
* Submit Bugs to Jira.

**Prerequisites**

* Install [Jira Integration plugin](https://store.katalon.com/product/3/Jira-Integration) for Katalon Studio from Katalon Store.
* Install [Katalon app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217501/katalon-bdd-test-automation-for-jira) for Jira from Atlassian Marketplace.

> Notes
> 
> If you need to enable Jira integration with [Katalon TestOps](https://analytics.katalon.com) to have an insightful look at your testing data and better test management. Refer to [TestOps - Jira Integration](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-jira-config.html) to learn how to configure the integration.

## Configure Jira integration 

You need to enable JIRA Integration in order to submit issues to JIRA. Go to **Project > Settings > Plugins > JIRA**.

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jira-plugin-integration/config.png)

1. Select **Enable integration** option. The settings will be available for configuration.

  * Jira Cloud
    * *Server URL* must be in the form *https://<site_name>.atlassian.net*.

3. Enter the Jira JQL and click **OK**.
![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jira-plugin-integration/image2017-8-2-113A413A34.png)

4. In the displayed **Test Case Folder Selection** window, select the destination to store the issues. Click **OK**.
![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jira-plugin-integration/save_test_cases.png)

5. In the **Linked Jira Issues** window, click **OK**.
![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jira-plugin-integration/image2016-11-3-143A413A132.png)

If your test cases have already been linked to a JIRA ticket, Katalon Studio will not sync them again.

## Import BDD Feature Files

### Jira Server Integration

Once you have enabled the integration with Jira Server, you can import Jira BDD Feature Files to Katalon Studio. When importing test cases from Jira, please check **Link to BDD Feature File** &gt; **OK** &gt; Choose the destination to store the issues.

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jira-plugin-integration/sample.png)

A new Feature File (with the same name as the test case) will be created with the content from Jira BDD. Moreover, a RunFeature step will be created in the linked test case to Jira.

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jira-plugin-integration/bdd2.png)

### Jira Cloud Integration

> Introduced in version 7.8

When importing Jira tickets with BDD feature file from Jira Cloud, you can import the BDD field to Katalon Studio as well by turning on this setting in Project Settings.

1. Go to **Project/Settings/Plugins/Jira**.
2. In the **Fetch Options** section, select **Enable retrieving content of the specified custom field**.
   <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/configure-jira-integration/jira-bdd-78.png" width=100%>
3. Select a custom field from the list. Click **Fetch Custom Fields** to fetch the list from the connected Jira Cloud Server.

> Note: Only existing custom field ID is valid for this configuration.

4. Click **OK** to apply your settings. 

Once this setting is configured successfully in Project Settings, the custom fieldâ€™s content will be retrieved like in Jira Server integration. 

## View Test Results in Jira

After a test suite execution finishes, Katalon Studio automatically uploads a test result to the integrated Jira issue. You can view the test result and its attachments (if you have predefined in Project Settings) in Jira.

![](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/jira-plugin-integration/image2017-8-2-173A563A40.png)

## Submit an Issue to Jira

Bug submission options will be available in Test Reports after JIRA Integration setup is successfully configured.

1. Open a test execution in **Reports** that you want to review for issues. In **Test Cases Table**, a dedicated column for JIRA Integration will be enabled.

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

4. In case of creating a new JIRA issue (or Sub-task), a **JIRA native submission form** will be displayed. The following is an example form for creating a new JIRA issue:
![JIRA native submission form](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/katalon_studio_integration_with_jira_overview/JIRA-native-submission-form.png)

5. Based on your preferences in [JIRA Integration settings](/display/KD/JIRA+Integration#JIRAIntegration-Configuration), the **Summary**, **Screenshots**, **Logs, Reporter, and Description** of test cases will be populated and attached accordingly. Once done, click on the **Create** button at bottom of the form.

6. A created **JIRA issue** will have its **ID** recorded in the **Linked JIRA issues** list so that you can quickly navigate there from Katalon Studio. You can also edit linked JIRA issue or remove the linking of the created JIRA issue.![Linked JIRA issues](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/katalon_studio_integration_with_jira_overview/Linked-JIRA-issues1.png)

7. Once clicked on **ID**, you will be taken to **JIRA issues** page accordingly as shown below

![JIRA issues page](https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/katalon_studio_integration_with_jira_overview/JIRA-issues-page.png)

## JQL Syntax

Katalon Studio test execution status can be queried via [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-764478330.html). The syntax is as following:

```groovy
"Katalon Status"=<status>
```

Where Status value can be one of the following:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PASSED | The automation tests that executed successfully. |
| FAILED | The automation tests that failed to execute at certain steps. |
| INCOMPLETE | The automation tests that did not finish running all the steps due to other factors such as wrong syntax, power shortage, disconnected network, etc. |
| ERROR | The automation tests that have some errors occurred. |

For example, to search for all issues that have failed in Katalon Studio test execution_:_

## Use JQL Syntax to query all issues with a particular execution status

Katalon Studio's test execution status can be queried via [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-764478330.html). The syntax is as follows:

`"Katalon Status"="STATUS"`

For example, to search for the issues with *PASSED* status:
