## TestOps Terminology

**<details><summary>Agent</summary>**

Connects a local machine to the TestOps servers for Test Runs execution.

</details>

**<details><summary>API performance anomalies</summary>**

Identify web services that take more/less time to respond than usual by applying the local outlier factor (LOF) on 30 latest execution requests.
</details>

**<details><summary>Assertions</summary>**

Determine whether the automated Test Case succeeds or not.

Katalon TestOps provides users a specific view of Assertions in each Test Case to evaluate the quality of Test Cases and ensure your tested application/software is working correctly.

Assertions help checking whether a condition is true (e.g., whether labels, data, API responses are rendered correctly).

> Notes:
>
> Users configure Assertions in Katalon Studio and view them in TestOps once test reports are uploaded to Katalon TestOps.
</details>

**<details><summary>BDD Test Result</summary>**

Represents the result of a test following the behavior-driven development (BDD) conventions.

In Katalon TestOps, the features of BDD tests are displayed as Requirements, while Scenarios are displayed as Test Cases.
*This is configured in Katalon Studio and viewed in TestOps through reports being uploaded.
