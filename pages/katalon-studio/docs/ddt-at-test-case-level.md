<INTRODUCTION>

Katalon Studio offers data-driven testing at test case level. 

This is useful if you want to:
- Bind each test case to a fixed set of data.
- Run a test case with different test data combinations.

> **Requirements**
>
> * An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license.

In this article, we demonstrate how to manage data binding at test case level and execute them in a test suite.

## Data-driven testing at test case level

### Manage Test Case Variables
    
  1. Create a new test case. Go to **File > New > Test Case**.
  2. 

## Execute Test Suite with Associated Test Case

### Dynamic Test Suite


### Data-binding Test Suite

> **What is a Suite Test Case?**
>
> A Suite Test Case is a test case added to a test suite.


Katalon allows you to select Data Binding options between Test Case level and Suite Test Case level.
