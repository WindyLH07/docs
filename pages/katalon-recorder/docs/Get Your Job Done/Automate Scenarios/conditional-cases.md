Handling conditional cases may become important when you want your scenarios to be executed successfully under different circumstances. An example of that is a website whose functionality depends on the log-in state. You have to log in first, only then you can use the functionality.

The test scenario

1.  Go to <https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/>
2.  If you are not logged in, go to **Log in** screen then log in into the system. Otherwise, skip this step.
3.  Select **Hongkong CURA Healthcare Center** in the **Facility** drop down

## Record the scenario

1/ Start recording on Katalon Recorder

_Notes: Make sure that you are not logged in._

3/ Click on the hamburger menu then click on Login link

## Add conditional statements

Manually add **IF statement** to check the log-in state. If user is already logged in, then we want to only select the value. Otherwise, we want to log in into the system first.

1/ Add a new test step after Open command

2/ Add storeElementPresent step to store a value into a variable

3/ Add IF statement after storeElementPresent command

4/ Add ELSE statement before Select facility command

5/ Run the test several times

The test case should be passed for both cases, logged and not logged in.
