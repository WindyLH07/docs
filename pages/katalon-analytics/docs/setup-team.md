## Create a Team

Teams are groups of users that reflect the company's structures. A team is created by either Owner or Admin in an organization. Only members of a team can view and access the projects within that team.

In the top right corner, click **Settings** icon, and then click **Team Management**.

## **Team-level roles and permissions**

* **Owner** - is granted by default when creating new a team or transferred by other users, who has full permission related to the team, including users and projects of their team.
* **Admin** - is granted by the Owner, who has the privileges of the Owner but cannot transfer the team ownership to an existing team member.
* **User** - is automatically assigned when a person is first invited to collaborate in a team. Users can only monitor project progress.

## Invite a user to the team

* Only the team **Owner** or **Admin** can invite a user to the team.

> Note: Only the user in an organization can be invited to a team in that organization.

## Create Projects

A Katalon TestOps project is a handful of reports generated based on a dataset of automation test results which are imported by users. It would typically represent the development of automation testing work. A project is created only by Admins of a team with a particular name and automatically generated ID. There are many projects in a team.

* On the top right corner, click **Settings** icon.
* Click **Project Management**.
