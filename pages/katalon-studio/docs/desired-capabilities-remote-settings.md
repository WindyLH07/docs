Katalon Studio supports defining desired capabilities for execution on remote environments such as Selenium Grid and Katalium Server or cloud services such as Kobiton, SauceLabs or BrowserStacks. 

This article shows you how to configure desired capabilities for Remote execution and the location of desired capabilities files.

## Set desired capabilities for Remote execution in Katalon Studio 

To set desired capabilities for Remote execution, go to **Project > Settings > Desired Capabilities > Remote**.

Please refer to someÂ documents below as examples how to pass in desired capabilities from these providers:

1. [Kobiton](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/desired-capabilities-for-kobiton-devices.html)
2. [SauceLabs](/display/KD/SauceLabs+Integration)
3. [BrowserStack](/display/KD/BrowserStack+Integration)
4. [Katalium Server](https://docs.katalon.com/katalium-server/docs/katalium-server-katalon-studio-remote-machine.html)

Note that this Remote option is applied for all executions which support this kind of remote execution, so you can apply them in this option as well.

> Code sample can be found in this project: [https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/tips-and-tricks](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/tips-and-tricks)

Starting with **Katalon Studio version 6.3.0**, when Appium is set as `Remote server type`,  the **Appium Driver** option is available for you to choose between *Android Driver* and *iOS Driver*.
Then this selection is used for launching the correct Appium Driver to connect to Cloud Devices.



## Location of Desired Capabilities files

You can find the settings files for each environment in the `<your test project location>\settings\internal` folder. The files for each driver are named as follows:

| Driver | Settings' file |
| --- | --- |
| Remote Web Server| com.kms.katalon.core.webui.remote.properties |
