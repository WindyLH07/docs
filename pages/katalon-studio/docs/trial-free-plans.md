## Trial License

Valid email registration is eligible for a **30-day** trial of both **Katalon Studio Enterprise** and **Katalon Runtime Engine** floating licenses.

> The trial licenses are automatically generated and activated when you first log into the Katalon Studio application.

Each trial license can be activated on only one machine at a time. When your trial period expires, you need to subscribe to the paid license of each product to continue using it. Otherwise, the Katalon Studio free license will be automatically activated.

> Notes:
>
> Trial licenses work for 30 days.
>
> For **Offline license**, you cannot remove a machine ID registered for the trial licenses once it has been activated.

To purchase licenses, please follow [this instruction](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-subscription.html).

* [Activate Katalon Runtime Engine License](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/activate-KRE.html)

## Free License

The free license granted for each Katalon account only includes the standard Katalon Studio with starter features. Currently, the free license for Katalon Runtime Engine is not available. If you wish to execute Katalon Studio in console mode, you need to subscribe to a Katalon Runtime Engine license. You can upgrade the free Katalon Studio to Katalon Studio Enterprise with a paid license without re-download.
