From version 5.6.0 onwards, Katalon Recorder (KR) users can export the entire test project to Katalon Studio (KS). 

With this feature, you can now scale up your projects by migrating the large test artifacts from KR to KS for continuous use of Katalon ecosystem, without the need to find an alternative framework when KR can no longer handle your larger and larger projects.

This feature allows you to:

* pull all your test artifacts in one place.
    
    By doing so, you can save time arranging all relevant test artifacts into the exported project in KS.

* preview the exported test artifacts.

    By doing so, you can detect problems faster and/or double check if your test articfacts are exported successfully.

* select and export your desired test artifacts to KS,

    By doing so, you can make sure their compatibilities with KS functions.

* monitor the export procedure.

    By doing so, you can ensure the smooth transition and reduce uncertainty.

To export a test project to KS, follow these steps:

1. Open Katalon Recorder.
2. On the left sidebar, go to **Export** > **Export to Katalon Studio**.

    The **Export to Katalon Studio** dialog appears as below.
