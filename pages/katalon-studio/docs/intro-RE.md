**Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE)** is the test execution add-on of Katalon Studio. KRE allows you to execute automation tests in CLI mode. It can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as scheduling your tests, integrating with CI/CD system, or bundling your tests to execute in virtual containers like Docker.

## Use Cases

KRE is only required for executing automation tests in CLI (command-line interface) mode. Here are the common scenarios for using KRE:

* Scheduling your tests using Operating System services. [Learn more](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/schedule-tests-to-execute.html).
* Creating batch operations for control multiple executions.
  * For example, setting up to autorun test suite B after running test suite A.
* Integrating your tests to your CI/CD system.
  * For example, setting up your tests to be trigger by Jenkins once the application under test (AUT) is updated.
* Execute your tests with distributed servers.
  * For example, setting up your tests to run with different Operating System, Browsers or Devices at the same time.
* Bundle your test execution into virtual containers.
  * For example, building a Docker image to execute your test with a specific environment.
* KRE is compatible with both Katalon Studio and Katalon Studio Enterprise.

## License

### Node-Locked License

This license model is applied to local desktops or workstations with fixed hardware specifications (machine-blocked license):

* Virtual machine with fixed machine ID
* Physical machine

The number of licenses to acquire should be based on the number of execution machines.

* A license is linked to a single machine ID and for one execution session.
* A machine can be mapped to multiple licenses (if needed).
* The license can be transferred to a new machine for an online environment. For the offline environment, once converted, the license cannot be transferred to another machine until it is expired.

### Floating License

This license type is applied to all types of execution environments, including cloud or virtual machines with dynamic hardware specifications (to execute tests in [Docker](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/docker.html) or [Azure DevOps plugin](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/azure-devops-extension.html))

* One license is assigned to one execution session.
* Each floating license can be shared across multiple accounts â€” maximum of 3 accounts at a time.
