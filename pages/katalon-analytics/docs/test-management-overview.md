Test Management is a test hub gathering and connecting all quality data from multiple sources such as Katalon Studio, JUnit, TestNG, and Jira.

Using Test Management, you can monitor test analytics for your projects.

You can also leverage it to gain critical insights into test results and integrate seamlessly with Katalon Studio and Jira for more efficient project management.

## Requirements

A requirement represents the Jira issue that is linked to a test case.

On the **Requirements** page, you can check the following information:

* The total number of requirements (Jira Requirements and BDD Features).

    > Notes:
