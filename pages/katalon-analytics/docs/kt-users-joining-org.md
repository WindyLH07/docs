## Join an Organization 
As a user of an Organization, you will receive an invitation email from the Owner/Admin to join the Organization.

> Notes:
>
> If you are an Owner/Admin of your Organization, follow this guide [TestOps User Management](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt_invite_user_org.html#invite-a-user-to-join-an-organization) to invite users to your Organization instead.

To accept the invitation to join an Organization, follow these steps:

1. Check your email address to find the Katalon TestOps invitation email.

2. Click on the invitation link in the email.

     You will be directed to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login).

3. Sign in to Katalon TestOps.
 
    The invitation page appears.

4. Click **Join** to become a Member of the Organization.

    You will see a message saying *You are now a member of [Organization name]*.

You have had access to the Organization. You can now use the product license that the Owner/Admin has assigned to you.

> Notes:
>
> If you decline the invitation to join the Organization, you won't have access to that Organization.
