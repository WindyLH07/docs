You might encounter situations when your session has been terminated due to a specific reason related to the license mechanism. This section explains some common causes of your session termination.

**Inactive session; the license has been transferred to <another_user>.**

* When your session is inactive, another licensed user from your Organization can occupy your license.

**Your account has logged in on another machine.**

* One Katalon account can be active on one machine at a time.

**This machine has been removed from the registered list.**

* This happens when your Organization Admins or Owner remove your machine from the registered list on Katalon TestOps. This removal ends your session on the Katalon Studio app.
