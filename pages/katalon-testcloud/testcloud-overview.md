description: Introducing TestCloud and Beta Testing program for Katalon users
---

Katalon TestCloud is a **cloud-based test execution environment** where you can automate test scripts across the most common and updated browsers and/or operating systems (OS) and/or a combination of both.

Katalon TestCloud is developed following our users needs to test their products in all possible environments and scenarios with ease and less complexity. TestCloud saves time and reduces the cost of creating physical infrastructure to simulate the same platforms for test automation.

With TestCloud, users can simultaneously and instantly test their application across multiple browsers and OS in just a few clicks, avoiding any hassle with infrastructure setup, infrastructure requirements and maintenance as well as IT dependency.

The simplicity and practicality TestCloud offers would address the following problems:

* Difficulty and inability to test across browsers and OS effectively.
* Scalability issues due to expensive infrastructure and slow process in setting up physical labs.
* Time-consuming configuration and integration for the test execution to work in different environments and scenarios.
* Limited availability of test scenarios/devices/OS/browsers.

**No setup and maintenance required** to use TestCloud as your test environment.

TestCloud also supports any request for readiness to integrate with your CI/CD pipelines.

Katalon TestCloud (Beta) is now available for seamless [integration with Katalon TestOps](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-testcloud/docs/integrate-testcloud-with-testops.html) and Katalon Studio (coming soon) to increase your testing environment options and reduce your waiting time in software deployment. As an existing Katalon user, you can benefit from our Beta Testing program.
