This article shows you how to set up Xcode simulators and real iOS devices to test iOS applications with Katalon Studio.

To begin with, you need to setup a macOS environment. You can not execute iOS mobile testing in Windows.
## Part 1: Setting up the environment for iOS testing

1. Install Xcode version 10.2 or newer. You can download Xcode from the App Store or the Apple Developer website: [Xcode 13](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

   > Notes:
   >
   > * Xcode must support the current version of your iOS device.
   > * Katalon Studio can only support iOS version 9.0 or above. To learn more about the supported environment in Katalon Studio, you can refer to this document: [Supported environment](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/supported-environments.html#mobile).

2. Install the command-line tool for Xcode. You can download the command-line tool compatible with your Xcode version from the Apple Developer website here: [Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/).

   Alternatively, you can copy and paste the following command-line arguments in this order in the **Terminal** to install the command-line tool for Xcode:

      `xcode-select --install`

      `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`

3. Install Appium version 1.12.1 or newer. You can install Appium via NPM or by downloading Appium Desktop. Follow the instructions in the Appium document here: [Getting started](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/#installing-appium).

   > Notes:
   > * We recommend installing the latest Appium version.
   > * In case you are installing Appium via NPM, make sure you install Node.js into a location where you have full Read/Write permissions.
   > * If you are using emulators other than Xcode simulators, some emulators come with Appium installed. If you want to run an application on an emulator, check your emulator settings before installing Appium.
## Part 2: Install extra dependencies to test real iOS device

> If you execute mobile testing on Xcode simulators only, skip this part.

1. Install Homebrew. Homebrew is a package manager that makes it easy to install other extra dependencies. To install Homebrew, follow the instructions on the Homebrew website: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

2. After installing Homebrew, you can now use it to install the following dependencies in the **Terminal**:

   - ios-deploy version 1.9.4 or newer. You can learn more about ios-deploy in this Github project: [ios-deploy](https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy). To install ios-deploy via Homebrew, copy and paste the command-line argument as below:

      `brew install ios-deploy`

   - usbmuxd version 1.0.10 or newer. You can learn more about usbmuxd in this Github project: [usbmuxd](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/usbmuxd). To install usbmuxd via Homebrew, copy and paste the following command-line arguments in this order:

      `brew install --HEAD usbmuxd`

      `brew unlink usbmuxd`

      `brew link usbmuxd`

   - libimobiledevice version 1.2.0 or newer. You can learn more about libimobiledevice on the libimobiledevice website: [libimobiledevice](https://libimobiledevice.org/). To install libimobiledevice via Homebrew, copy and paste the following command-line arguments in this order:
         
      `brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice`

      `brew unlink libimobiledevice`

      `brew link libimobiledevice`

   - For Appium version older than 1.20.0, you need to install Carthage. You can learn more about Carthage in this Github project: [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). To install Carthage via Homebrew, copy and paste the command-line argument below:

      `brew install carthage`

   - For Appium version older than 1.15.0, you also need to install ios-webkit-debug-proxy. You can learn more about ios-webkit-debug-proxy in this Github project: [ios-webkit-debug-proxy](https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy). To install ios-webkit-debug-proxy via Homebrew, copy and paste the command-line argument as below:

      `brew install ios-webkit-debug-proxy`
## Part 3: Set up the iOS devices/ Xcode simulators for mobile testing in Katalon Studio

<details><summary>For Xcode simulators</summary>

   After installing Xcode, Katalon automatically recognizes Xcode simulators as iOS devices. To check whether Katalon successfully recognizes Xcode simulators, on the main toolbar, select the **iOS** device in the dropdown list next to **Run**.

   You should see a list of pre-installed Xcode simulators appearing as iOS devices. You can now move on to [Part 4: Install the WebDriverAgent](https://docs.katalon.com//katalon-studio/docs/mobile-on-macos.html/#part-4-install-the-webdriveragent).

</details>

<details><summary>For real iOS devices</summary>

1. Any device for development with Xcode must be listed in the Apple developer portal. To learn about listing your device in Apple Developer Portal, you can refer to the wikiHow document here: [How to Add a New Device to Your Apple Developer Portal](https://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-New-Device-to-Your-Apple-Developer-Portal).
2. In **Xcode > Preferences > Account**, click *Add* (+) to enter your Mobile Developer Apple ID and password.
3. Connect your iOS devices to your computer via a USB cable. Confirm to accept or trust the phone.
4. To enable **UI Automation** on the device, navigate to **Settings > Developer**. In the **UI Automation** section, turn on the setting for **Enable UI Automation**.
5. If you want to execute your tests using Safari on iOS (mobile browser), you will need to enable the following settings in **Settings > Safari > Advanced**:

    - JavaScript
    - Web Inspector
    - Remote Automation

## Part 4: Install the WebDriverAgent

The WebDriverAgent is a WebDriver server used to control iOS devices remotely. To install the WebDriverAgent, you can refer to this document: [Install WebDriverAgent for iOS devices](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/installing-webdriveragent-for-ios-devices.html#setting-up-the-ios-device).
## Part 5: Prepare the iOS application file

<details><summary>For Xcode simulators</summary>

To execute mobile testing with Xcode simulators, you need to prepare an `.app` file.
To get the `.app` file from the Xcode project, go to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/{app name}/Build/Products/{scheme}-iphonesimulator/{app name}.app`. 

> Notes:
> 
> To quickly search for the `DerivedData` folder, copy and paste the following path `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` into the **Spotlight**. 

For example: To find the `app` file from the **Coffee Timer** project, go to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Coffee Timer/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Coffee Timer.app`.

</details>

<details><summary>For Real iOS devices</summary>

To execute mobile testing with real iOS devices, you need to:

1. Prepare the `.ipa` file. Follow these steps:
   
   > If you already have the `.ipa` file built and signed, skip this step.

   - Open the project file with Xcode. For example, to open `Coffee Timer.xcodeproj`:

      From where you store the project > **App** > **Your-First-iOS-App** > **Coffee Timer**. Double-click the `Coffee Timer.xcodeproj` file.

      <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/mobile-recorder-76/iOS/open-xcode-file.png" width=50%>

   - After opening the project in Xcode, select an iOS device to launch the apps.

      <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/mobile-recorder-76/iOS/select-device.png" width=35%>

   - In the **General** tab, set deployment iOS version and select device type in the **Deployment Info** section.

      <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/mobile-recorder-76/iOS/deployment.png" width=45%>

   - Switch to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab, check the **Automatically manage signing** box, then choose a team added added before.

   - To build the `.ipa` file, click **Product > Build**. 

   - To export the `.ipa` file, click **Product > Archive**. Follow the instructions to get the `Coffee Timer.ipa` file.

      <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/mobile-recorder-76/iOS/export.gif" width=70%>

2. Verify the `.ipa` file, follow these steps:

   - Navigate toÂ **Window > Devices** in Xcode.
   - Choose your device from the **Devices** list.
   - Click *Add* (+) to browse the `.ipa` file.

   - Once installed successfully, the application appears in the **Installed Apps** section.
