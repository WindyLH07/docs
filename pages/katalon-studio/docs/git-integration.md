Git is an essential and popular system for version control. Suppose your Katalon Studio automation project involves several or more members. In that case, you should use Git or another source control system for managing change and configuration on your test project. A Git repository can be shared across multiple team members to help improve the team's collaboration and productivity.

Below are several benefits of using Git for your Katalon Studio projects:  

- Git allows undoing mistakes. The undo ability gives project teams the courage to try out ideas and concepts without worrying about the risk of breaking stuff and, thus, fosters a culture of innovation.
- Git makes the team progress clearer:
  - A commit in Git refers to a change in automation scripts that a team member makes, indicating the progress of tasks.
  - Git supports comparing versions of code to show differences between commits. It is useful to review a commit before it officially becomes final.
- Git supports working offline. Being to work offline makes your team more fail-safe. Each member can perform everything on his/her computer, independent from possible infrastructure downtime.
- Never losing data ever again. As daily work can be committed to the remote Git server, every team member working on a project has a full-fledged copy on his/her machine, including the project's complete change history.
- If any backup breaks down, restore it using any team member's local repository or Git repository.

## About Git Integration

The Git integration supported in Katalon Studio is based on **EGit**. You can refer to [http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide) for a detailed user guide regarding EGit. A typical workflow of Git integration with Katalon Studio is depicted in the following diagram:

<img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/git_integration_introduction/Katalon-and-Git.png" width=70%>

You can integrate Katalon Studio with **Git** and its cloud-hosted services, including:

* GitHub
* GitLab
* BitBucket
* Microsoft Azure DevOps

## Configure Git Integration

1. **Enable Git Integration:** To access all Git features, you need to enable Git Integration first. The option is available in the following settings: **Katalon Studio >  Preferences > Katalon > Git**. Once enabled, you can start using Git at Katalon Studio's main toolbar.

## Resolve Git conflicts using Katalon Studio

### Why do we have Git conflicts?

- In a source control system like Git, conflicts occur when two or more people make changes to the same file concurrently. The conflicts may appear at a member's local repository or Git remote repository. 

- To avoid conflicts, the team must collaborate following several Git practices. For example, before **pushing** new source code to the Git remote repository, one must remember to **fetch** the latest version from Git remote repository, **resolve** any conflicts, and **merge** the code with the local version.

- The chart below demonstrates how conflicts may occur when Tom and Emma are working on the same project. The conflicts occur when Tom and Emma try to push new code to the Git remote repository without updating the changes from each other.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/git_conflict_resolve/Git-conflict.png" width=70%>

### Resolve Git conflicts using Katalon Studio

**Given situation:**

- Tom and Emma are working on the same test case in a test project. Emma added a new comment ("EMMA ADDED THIS COMMENT"), then committed and pushed the change to the Git remote repository.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/git_conflict_resolve/Git-conflict-2.png" width=70%>

- At almost the same time, Tom also added a  new comment ("TOM ADDED THIS COMMENT"), then committed and tried to push to the Git remote repository.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/git_conflict_resolve/Resolve-Git-conflict-2.png" width=70%>

- Unfortunately, since Emma had pushed the code before Tom, so the version of code in Git was different from the version of code in Tom's local repository, and therefore, Git rejected Tom's  push action.

**Question: What should Tom do to push its change to the Git remote control?**

- First, Tom has to pull the code from the Git remote repository to his local machine.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/git_conflict_resolve/Resolve-Git-conflict-3.png" width=70%>

- Obviously, Tom will see a message about the conflict:

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/git_conflict_resolve/Resolve-Git-conflict-4.png" width=70%>

- In the **Script** mode of the test case **TC2_Verify Successful Appointment** in Tom's Katalon Studio project, there are errors with indicators such as "<<<<<<<" (convention from Git). Let's look at the script more carefully:

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/git_conflict_resolve/Resolve-Git-conflict-5.png" width=70%>

- Recall that the comments were added by Tom and Emma, and the conflict is now on Tom's Katalon Studio project. Everything within **"<<<<<<< HEAD"** and **"======="** is the change from Tom. And, everything within **"======="** and **">>>>>>\> branch 'master'…"** comes from Emma, which is currently in the Git remote repository.

- Now Tom has to decide which change is correct, or both are correct or wrong. Tom has to replace these lines of code with the correct ones. For example, "THIS IS THE CORRECT COMMENT":

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/git_conflict_resolve/Resolve-Git-conflict-6.png" width=70%>

- After resolving the conflict, Tom is now able to commit and push the change to the Git remote repository.

### Best practices

In order to minimize the conflict in a team having more than one member, you should define a process from the very beginning so that all team members are on the same page when using Git. 

Below are some suggestions for good practices:

-   **Commit often**: do not wait until a huge amount of scripts created to commit and push to the Git remote repository. The smaller the set of scripts is pushed, the easier you resolve the conflict.
-   **Pull** changes from the Git remote repository **before** working on new scripts and before **committing**.
   Each member works on **each feature at a time**.
