Validating expected values is important when you want to confirm that certain states are according to your expectations. For example, when you automate purchasing an item, you want to make sure that the name of the item reflects what you actually bought.

There are at least two ways to add a verify/assert statement to a scenario.

1.  Use context menu while recording.
2.  Add verify/assert commands from manual interface.

## Use context menu while recording.

After recording a test case, right-click on the element that you want to verify then select the corresponding command:

1.  Record your test steps

2.  At the very last step, **right-click** on the **element** that you want to **verify**

3.  Click on **Katalon Recorder (Selenium tests generator)** on the context menu

Then you got a new verify command.
