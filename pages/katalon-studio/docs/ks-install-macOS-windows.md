### Download Katalon Studio

- Do a quick check on System Requirements before using Katalon Studio. You can refer to this document here: [Supported Environment](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/supported-environments.html).
  
- Go to Katalon website and download the latest Katalon Studio version: [Katalon products](https://www.katalon.com/download/). 

   Katalon Studio automatically detects and downloads a suitable version for your system, but you can also select a preferred one on the page.

### Install Katalon Studio

**Windows**

- Double-click on the **katalon.exe** file.

- Ensure you are using the default font size (set to 100%) in both Katalon Studio and your current OS to avoid the name field not being displayed on some pop-up windows.

    To adjust the font size:
    * Windows: [Edit the font size](https://www.pcworld.com/article/242942/how_to_change_font_size.html).
    * Katalon Studio: **Window** > **Preferences** > **General** > **Appearance** > **Colors and Fonts**. Select **Dialog Font** and edit the font size.

> **Notes**
> 
> For Windows users, installing in custom folder (outside of the default `C:\Users\<username>`) would require you to run the software with Administrator privilege, or to adjust the Read/Write permission of Katalon Studio package for the current user.

**macOS**

- Double-click on the **Katalon Studio** (macOS) file in the directory where it is unpacked.

   > **For macOS Catalina users:**
   > 
   > * From version 7.9 onwards, macOS Catalina users no longer have to enable Katalon Studio and Katalon Studio Engine applications in **System Preferences**. 
   > 
   > * Users can start the applications directly as in macOS.

- Once started, the application should display the splash screen similar to the following screenshot:
