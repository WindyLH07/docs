[Web Service Object Parameterization](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/parameterize-a-web-service-object.html) in Katalon Studio allows you to perform data-driven testing (DDT) with web service.

This tutorial shows you how to set up a DDT test with web service. The test includes two requests to a web server and data binding with external source:

* A POST request to register user.

* A GET request to verify user identity.

* Data binding with a data sheet.
