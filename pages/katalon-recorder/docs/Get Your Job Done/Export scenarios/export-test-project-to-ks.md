From version 5.6.0 onwards, Katalon Recorder (KR) users can export the entire test project to Katalon Studio (KS).

This feature is especially useful to users outgrowing the capabilities of KR. As your work requirements and projects complexity increase, you can move your test artifacts and projects to KS. This allows you to benefit from Studio's more advanced features without losing your work.

This feature allows you to:

* pull all your test artifacts in one place.
    
    By doing so, you can save time arranging all relevant test artifacts into the exported project in KS.

* preview the exported test artifacts.

    By doing so, you can detect problems faster and/or double check if your test articfacts are exported successfully.

* select and export your desired test artifacts to KS,

    By doing so, you can make sure their compatibilities with KS functions.

* monitor the export procedure.

    By doing so, you can ensure the smooth transition and reduce uncertainty.

To export a test project to KS, follow these steps:

1. Open Katalon Recorder.
2. On the left sidebar, go to **Export** > **Export to Katalon Studio**.

    The **Export to Katalon Studio** dialog appears as below.
