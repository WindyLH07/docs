Katalon Studio provides an easy-to-use Debug mode, allowing investigating the root causes of failed Test Cases more quickly. 

This tutorial demonstrates how to debug a Test Case in the Debug mode.

In our example, the application under test (AUT) is an online shopping website. We want to execute a Test Case that performs ordering and checking out a single product, but with an incorrect Object locator. After running the Test Case, we analyze the failed Test execution results and debug the Test Case.

> You can download the sample project here: [Shopping Cart Tests](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/shopping-cart-tests).
