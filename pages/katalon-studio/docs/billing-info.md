## Edit credit card information

In Katalon TestOps, only credit cards are supported, and you can save one card in each organization.

To edit credit card information, in the **Payment Method** section, click **Update** and enter another card’s details. When you’re done, click **Save**.

The newly added card is automatically added to other subscriptions for future payments.

## Delete an existing credit card

You cannot undo this action. Once you delete the card, it is permanently removed from your organization.

To delete an existing credit card, in the **Payment Method** section, click **Delete** and confirm your action.

## Update billing information

Katalon sends invoices and other billing-related communication to the Organization Owners or Billing Managers by default. In the **Billing Information** section, you can add cc emails to receive these emails. Email addresses are separated by commas. Cc emails is particularly helpful for an enterprise where the person in charge of billing does not need to be involved in Katalon Organization.

To update your billing information, in the **Billing Information** section, click **Update** and enter the billing information. When you are done, click **Save Billing Information**.
