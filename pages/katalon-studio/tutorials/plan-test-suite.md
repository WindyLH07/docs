## Plan a Test Suite

Planning a test suite helps prevent restructuring of test cases and execution errors.

Ask yourself the following questions:
* What is your test suite goal?
* How do you want to execute your test suite?

## Define Test Suite goals

A test suite could compile a series of actions depicting a particular user experience on your website.

You plan test cases based on deciding which action a test case should perform. You then create a test suite flow by naming and ordering test cases.

## Test Suite execution

Once defining test suite goals, the following tutorials could support your test suite execution step by step:
1. [Create a new test suite](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite.html#create-a-new-test-suite).
2. Plan test suite operation.
* [Modify execution information](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite.html#modify-execution-information).
* [Manage test case list](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite.html#manage-test-case-list).
3. View [test suite reports](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite-report.html#test-suite-report).

    Katalon Studio logs test suite results in different formats and provides a complete account of the test suite process to help spot errors and reduce test case restructuring time.
