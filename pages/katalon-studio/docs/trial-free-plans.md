## Trial License

Users registering with a valid email are eligible for a **30-day** trial of both **Katalon Studio Enterprise** and **Katalon Runtime Engine** floating licenses.

> The trial licenses are automatically generated and activated when you first log into the Katalon Studio application.

Each trial license can be activated on only one machine at a time.

You can start using KSE and KRE for 30 days. When your trial period expires, you need to purchase licenses to continue using KSE and KRE, or you can use the Katalon Studio free license with basic testing features.

> Notes:
>
> For **Offline license**, you cannot remove a machine ID registered for the trial licenses once it has been activated.

To purchase licenses, see [Purchase Katalon License](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-subscription.html).

To activate trial licenses, see [Activate Katalon License](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/activate-KSE.html).
## Free License

The free license offers core features of the low-code test automation experience in Katalon Studio. You can see a breakdown of features available to free users here: [Types of Licenses](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license.html).

Currently, the free license does not include Katalon Runtime Engine and console mode features.

You can upgrade Katalon Studio to Katalon Studio Entreprise at any time without re-download.
