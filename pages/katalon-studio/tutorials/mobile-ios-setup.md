The iOS-mobile-tests perform UI functional automation test on an iOS application using Katalon Studio.
   
This topic describes the preliminary actions you need to perform to prepare the environment for testing iOS applications with Katalon Studio.

## Set up iOS tests on Windows and macOS

### On Windows machine

   You can only test an **iOS** application using **macOS**.

### On macOS machine
   
   1. Supported environments

   * Appium: 1.12.1 onwards
   * iOS: 9.x onwards
   
     > **Note**
     >
     > Some emulators come with Appium installed. If you want to run an application on an emulator, check your emulator settings before installing Appium.
     >
     > Xcode must support the current version of your IOS device.
     >
     > We recommend upgrading Appium to the latest version.
   
   2. Install the following required components

   * Appium v1.12.1 or newer. 
   * Xcode 10.2 or newer.
   * Command-line tool for Xcode.
   * Carthage 0.33 or newer.
   * ios-deploy 1.9.4 or newer.
   * ios-webkit-debug-proxy 1.8.4 or newer.
   * libimobiledevice 1.2.0 or newer.
   * usbmuxd 1.0.10 or newer.
   * WebDriverAgent.

         `brew install node`\
         `npm install -g appium`
      
         > **Note**
         >
         > Make sure you install Node.js into a location where you have full **Read** and **Write** permissions.

         `brew unlink usbmuxd`\
         `brew link usbmuxd`

      8. **Install libimobiledevice**
   
         `brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice`\
         `brew unlink libimobiledevice`\
         `brew link libimobiledevice`

      9. **Install ios-webkit-debug-proxy**
   
         `brew install ios-webkit-debug-proxy`

      10. **Install WebDriverAgent**

          Follow these links:

          * [Installing WebDriverAgent for iOS devices](/display/KD/Installing+WebDriverAgent+for+iOS+devices).
          * [WebDriverAgent project page](https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent).

      </details>

   3. Set up the devices

   * Connect your iOS devices to your computer via a USB cable. Confirm to accept or trust the phone.
   * If you want to execute your tests using Safari on iOS (mobile browser), make sure **Web Inspector** is turned on for **Safari** (**Settings > Safari > Advanced > Web Inspector**).
   * Enable the service **UI automation** on the devices.
   * Connect the iOS devices to **Xcode**.
   * Go to **Settings** on the iOS devices > **Developer** > turn on **UIAutomation**.

## Verify the iOS application file

Before diving further into testing, make sure the iOS native application file (**.ipa** file) is verified.

   - If the application file is already built and signed correctly, follow these steps:

      - Open **Xcode** and navigate to **Window/Devices**.
      - Choose your device from the **Devices** list.
      - Click the "**+**" button and choose your application file.

   - If the application is not built, do as follows:

      - Open the project file with **Xcode** tool. For example, to open **Coffe Time.xcodeproj**:

         From where you store the project > **App** > **Your-First-iOS-App** > **Coffee Timer** > **Coffee Timer.xodeproj**.

      - In Xcode:
         - Select a device to launch the apps.

         - Set deployment iOS version and select device type in **General**/**Deployment Info**.

            <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/mobile-recorder-76/iOS/deployment.png" width=45%>

         - Build the apps by clicking **Product -> Build**. Wait until the build progress is finished.

            > Make sure to select your **Team** in **Signing & Capabilities**.

         - Export the apps by clicking **Product -> Archive** then follow the instruction to get "**Coffee Time.ipa**" file.
         - Store **Coffee Time.ipa** file into **App** folder. Katalon Studio will use the exported file to start Coffee Timer application.
