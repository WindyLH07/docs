As an Organization Owner or Billing Manager, you can update your billing settings, including payment method, billing information, and billing email recipients at any time.

To update payment method and billing information, follow these steps:

1. Log in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/)
2. Select your **Organization**. Go to **Settings > License Management > Payment Method**. The **Payment Method** page appears.

## Edit credit card information

In Katalon TestOps, only credit cards are supported, and you can only save one card in each organization.

If you already added your credit card and wished to replace it with a new one, in the **Payment Method** section, click **Update**.

You can enter another cardâ€™s details, then click **Add new card**. The old credit card information is replaced with the new card.

The replaced card is automatically added to other subscriptions for future payments.

## Delete an existing credit card

> Notice:
>
> You cannot undo this action. Once you delete the card, it is permanently removed from your organization.

To delete an existing credit card, in the **Payment Method** section, click **Delete** and confirm your action.

## Update billing information

Katalon sends invoices and other billing-related communication to the Organization Owners or Billing Managers by default. In the **Billing Information** section, you can add cc emails to receive these emails. Cc emails are particularly helpful for an enterprise where the person in charge of billing does not need to be involved in your Katalon Organization.

To update your billing information, in the **Billing Information** section, click **Update** and enter the billing information. Email addresses are separated by commas. When you are done, click **Save Billing Information**.
