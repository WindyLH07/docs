## Populate a Jira Release

> Notes:
>
> You must enable Jira integration in Katalon TestOps first.

There are two ways to populate Releases from Jira:

* You create a new Release.

OR

* You populate a Jira Release.

### Create Releases

Once you enable Jira integration in Katalon TestOps, the **Jira Project** and **Jira Release** sections are added in the **Create Release** page.

### Populate Jira Releases

Once you enable Jira integration in Katalon TestOps, the **Populate Jira Releases** button appears next to the **Create Release** button in the **Releases** page.

4. Click on the ID number of a Test Run.

    The **Test Run: #** page appears, and **#** represents the ID number (e.g., **Test Run: #21**).

3. Click on the **Link to a release** button at the top right corner.

    The dropdown menu appears.

4. Select a Release in the dropdown menu.

> Notes:
>
> After linking the Test Runs to a Release, these Test Runs are shown under the **Release** section on your Jira page.

### Link Test Runs to a different Release

If you have already linked a Test Run to a Release, the **Test Run: #** page displays as below.

For example, **Test Run: #1234** has already been linked to Release **8.0**.

You can link this Test Run to a different Release by clicking on the button next to the current Release (next to **8.0**).

The scrolldown menu appears as below.
