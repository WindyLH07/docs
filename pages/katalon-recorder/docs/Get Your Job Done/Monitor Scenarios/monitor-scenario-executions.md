## View your last execution status locally

After you execute a scenario, a group of scenarios or all scenarios, the execution status is available under the explorer. You can see the number of passed and failed executions.

## Save an execution log locally

## Upload and view past executions via TestOps

You can integrate Katalon Recorder with [Katalon TestOps](https://www.katalon.com/testops/)) to upload and view execution history.

**Execute a scenario/group of scenarios/all scenarios**

To upload your execution, you have to execute scenarios first. You can start uploading execution results when the execution log is available.

**Click on Report button**
