* The screen displays the current subscription and TestOps plans as above.
* You can only subscribe to one plan at a time. 
4. Click **Upgrade** on the current plan.
5. Adjust the number of test results and review the new plan.
6. Click **Checkout** to complete the process.

## Upgrade to Annual billing cycle

A yearly billing cycle helps you save costs. You can only upgrade monthly subscriptions to annual ones.

Successful payment will immediately change your subscription. After upgrading, you can find new subscription information updated on the **TestOps Subscriptions** page.
