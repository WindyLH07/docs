You can invite your team members into your Organization to work on projects.

> Requirements:
>
> You need a Katalon account. Register [Katalon account](https://www.katalon.com/sign-up/) if you don't have one.

## Roles and permissions at the Organization level

* **Owner**

By default, you become the Owner of the Organization you have created.

The Owner can manage the Organization, Teams, Users, Projects, licenses, plugins, and subscriptions.

The Owner can also transfer ownership to another member.

* **Admin**

This role is granted by the Owner.

The Admin has similar privileges as the Owner but cannot manage the subscriptions.

* **User**

This role is automatically assigned to a person who joins an Organization.

Users can only monitor the project's progress.

* **Billing Manager**

This role is granted by the Owner or Admins.

The Billing Manager has similar privileges as the User and can also manage subscriptions.
