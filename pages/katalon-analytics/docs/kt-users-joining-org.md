2. Sign in on the TestOps page.
 
    The invitation page appears.

3. Click **Join** to become a Member of the Organization.

    You will see a message saying *You are now a member of [Organization name]*.

You have had access to the Organization. You can now use the product license that the Owner/Admin has assigned to you.

> Notes:
>
> If you decline the invitation to join the Organization, you won't have access to that Organization.
