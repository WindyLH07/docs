There are three types of variables supported in Katalon Studio:

- Groovy Variable

- Test Case Variable

- Global Variable (Execution Profiles)

## Groovy Variables

> Katalon Studio supports Groovy programming language from version 2.4.x onwards.

You can define variables in Groovy in Katalon Studio. To learn more about Groovy programming language, you can refer to the Apache Groovy document: [Groovy documentation](http://groovy-lang.org/semantics.html). 

For example:

```groovy
// x is defined as a variable of String type
String x = "Hello";
Â 
// y is defined as a variable of int type
int y = 5;

// The value of the variables are printed to the console
println(x);
println(y);
```

## Test Case Variables

Katalon Studio allows you to create test case variables and call test cases with variables.
To learn more about managing test case variables and calling test cases with variables, you can refer to this document: [Test case variables](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-case-variables.html#manage-test-case-variables).

You can also use test case variables in a test suite, To learn more about binding data for test suite execution, you can refer to this document: [Manage data binding](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/run-test-case-external-data.html).

## Global Variables

A global variable is a variable defined in the execution profile and can be used in a test case, test object, web service object, and email configuration in a project.
To learn more about global variables and execution profile, you can refer to this document: [Global Variables and Execution Profile](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/execution-profile-v54.html#execution-profile).
