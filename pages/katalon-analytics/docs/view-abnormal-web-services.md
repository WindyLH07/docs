Katalon TestOps automatically detects abnormal Web Services. This feature enhances failure detection.

Go to your Project > **Reports & Analytics** > **Web Services**, then select the **Anomalies** tab. 

You can view a list of API requests which have taken less or much more time than usual to respond.

Go to the detail page of each Web Service call to export an API request as HAR.
