## Invite and enable SSO for Organization members

After you have configured SSO for your Organization, you can invite and enable SSO for each member.

### Invite and enable SSO for a new user

1. Learn how to invite users to an organization [here](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/setup-org-team-project.html#invite-a-user-to-the-organization).

2. In the **Login Options** section in the **Invite users** page, enable the SSO option and click on **Invite** to finish.

3. A request to enable SSO will be sent to invited users. 

This action will be *pending* until your member [accepts the request](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/setup-org-team-project.html#invite-a-user-to-the-organization).

> Note: The *â€œVerify Single Sign-On authentication"* email will be sent to invited users once they have accepted the invitation to join the organization.

### Enable SSO for an existing member

1. To enable SSO for an existing member in an organization, in **Katalon Admin** page, go to **Users** and select an account you want to enable SSO. 

2. Click on the pencil icon to go to the details page.

3. In the **Login Options** section in the user's details page, enable the SSO option.

4. A request to enable SSO will be sent to invited users. 

This action will be pending until your member [accepts the request](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/setup-org-team-project.html#invite-a-user-to-the-organization).

> You need to enable SSO for your own account in order to login via SSO.

## View and Manage User Authentication

### View Pending SSO Requests

After enabling SSO for your member, the pending request will be displayed in the **Users** page.

Before the member have accepted the request, you can withdraw it by removing the URL from the pending list. Once you have confirmed your action, the member will no longer be able to access your request URL.

You can update the login options (SSO and/or Username & Password) for members in the **Login Settings** section.
