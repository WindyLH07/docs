A valid business email registration is eligible for a 30-day trial of **TestOps Business** and/or a 45-day trial of **TestOps Enterprise**.

When your trial period expires, you need to purchase a monthly or annual subscription. Otherwise, your plan is reverted to **TestOps Free**.

> Notes:
>
> The trial request is applied for Cloud version only. TestOps no longer supports an On-Premises solution.
