When executing tests on TestCloud in Windows with Chrome version 93.x or 94.x, users may come across the following error:

```
SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created
from timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer: 600.000
```

The tests hang on launching the browser and eventually time out. This is an issue from Chrome itself that doesnâ€™t allow the ChromeDriver to start as Windows service normally.

There are two ways to solve this issue:

1. Downgrade to Chrome version 92.x
2. Set `--disable-gpu` for the desired capability in Chrome. For Katalon Studio users, to do so, go to **Project Settings > Desired Capabilities > Web UI > Chrome**. Click **Add**, then input as follows:

    <table width="587">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Name</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Value</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>args</td>
    <td>List</td>
    <td>--disable-gpu</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
