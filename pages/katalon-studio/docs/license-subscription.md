[Katalon licenses](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license.html) are purchased and managed via **Organizations** in [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/). Only the Organization Owner or Billing Managers can subscribe to Katalon licenses.

If you need further assistance with Katalon Pricing and Subscription, contact our sales team via business@katalon.com.
